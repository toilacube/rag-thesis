Given the following conversation history and the latest user question, determine if retrieving information from a knowledge base (vector search) is necessary to provide a comprehensive and accurate answer.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object with two keys: "need_rag" (boolean) and "reason" (string, explaining your decision briefly).

Conversation History (if any):
{{#history}}
- {{role}}: {{content}}
{{/history}}

Latest User Question:
"{{user_question}}"

Consider the following:
- Is the question asking for specific factual information that might be in a document?
- Is the question about a topic likely covered in the project's knowledge base?
- Can the question be answered with general knowledge, or does it require specific context?
- Avoid RAG for simple greetings, chit-chat, or very general questions unless they hint at needing specific data.

Your JSON response:
```json
{
  "need_rag": boolean,
  "reason": "string"
}
